# OpenFace_ME_Demo
Frame analysis of Micro-Expressions detected from webcam

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 using Python 3.5
This work was developed using OpenFace (https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki) to extract features. Of particular interest for this demo are the intensities of the detected micro-expressions (https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Action-Units). Note that you should install OpenFace on your system as explained in their Wiki in order to run this demo.
When you run the program, two windows will display (one showing the tracked video and another one showing the predicted ME).  When you want to stop recording, press the q key. You'll be taken to a new gui, where you can analyze each ME indepently along time (frames)
